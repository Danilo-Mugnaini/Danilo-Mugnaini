## Hello World! 👋
Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where code meets coffee (lots of coffee ☕)!

## About Me 👨‍💻
Telecom Analyst - NOC - Field Tech Support - Coding and Cybersecurity Student

I'm an IT professional with over 5 years of experience in technical support. I've dived deep into the realms of hardware maintenance, wrestled with IT infrastructures, and tamed countless IT assets. When I'm not busy helping people troubleshoot their tech woes, I'm honing my skills in cybersecurity, dreaming of a world where passwords are strong and data breaches are but a myth.

## What I Do 🚀
**Tech Whisperer**: I speak fluent Windows and Linux. Need help with your gadgets?

**IT Infrastructure Guru**: From setting up IT infrastructures to ensuring everything runs like a well-oiled machine, I've got it covered.

**Customer Service Ninja**: I excel in making tech talk less scary and more friendly. 

**Network Admin**: I manage networks with the precision of a tightrope walker. Routing, switching, and network security are my playgrounds.

## Currently Learning Cybersecurity 🔒
On a mission to become a Cybersecurity Analyst. Studying hard to make the cyber world a safer place, one line of code at a time.
